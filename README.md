# Fritz Models
A collection of machine and deep learning models designed to run on mobile devices.

Models in this repository contain code and utility for training models as well as converting them to mobile-friendly formats like Core ML, TensorFlow Mobile, and TensorFlow Lite.

## Models

* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-models/tree/master/style_transfer): Transform images into works of art by transfering the style of one image onto the content of another.
* [Image Segmentation](https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-models/tree/master/image_segmentation): Semantic segmentation of images. Assign a value to each pixel of an image corresponding to the type of object it belongs to.
* [Create ML Playgrounds](https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-models/tree/master/create_ml_playgrounds): A series of playgrounds for training models with Apple's Create ML tool
